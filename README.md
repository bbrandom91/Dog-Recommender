# dogRecommender
We created a dashboard for individuals who want to adopt a dog. The program recommends to users a dog from a shelter based on results from a questionnaire. This is accomplished with a nearest neighbor recommendation algorithm. Breeds available for adoption are scraped from a shelter website, and features associated with each breed are used in the nearest neighbor recommender.
